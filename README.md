## Installation Instructions for the Virtual Machine (VM)

- Download the virtual machine manager VirtualBox, from [virtualbox.org](https://www.virtualbox.org/). Make sure you pick the right operation system for your laptop. 
- Install VirtualBox on your machine
- Download the VM image (~4 GB) from dropfiles.uzh. Ask for the link.
- Run VirtualBox and do `File | Import Appliance` from the menu. Choose the VM image you just downloaded (file with extension .OVA). This will trigger a menu where you can change the Appliance settings. We recommend giving the VM as much memory as you can given your local machine (about 2/3 of the total memory, but between 2-4 GB). Start the import process.

Now you can start the VM by selecting it in the list and clicking on the Start button. Login with the VM password. 

### Copy/paste doesn't work in the command window

To copy, select text and click the title bar and go to Edit->Copy. You can use Edit->Paste to paste.  
  
  
The usual shortcuts for copy/paste don't work in the virtual machine. For Macs use ctrl+shift+C for copying and ctrl+shift+v for pasting.  
  
You can also setup shared folders between the VM and the host system. Ask us how to do it.


## Recommended books (Practical Computing Skills)

- [Haddock & Dunn. Practical Computing for Biologists. Sinauer Associates 2011.](http://practicalcomputing.org)  
  A good book that covers the shell/command line, programming in python & bash, databases, regular expressions. 
  Suitable for self-study and as a reference book.

- [Vince Buffalo. Bioinformatics Data Skills. O'reilly 2015](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030157.do)  
  This practical book teaches the skills that scientists need for turning large sequencing datasets into reproducible and robust biological findings.
  Also covers methods on Sequence and Alignment Data. 
  More advanced than Haddock & Dunn and progresses with faster pace.
