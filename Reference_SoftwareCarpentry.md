#Â The Unix Shell

## Reference

from http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/reference.html


*   A shell is a program whose primary purpose is to read commands and run other programs.
*   The shell's main advantages are its high action-to-keystroke ratio,
    its support for automating repetitive tasks,
    and that it can be used to access networked machines.
*   The shell's main disadvantages are its primarily textual nature
    and how cryptic its commands and operation can be.

## [Files and Directories](01-filedir.html)

*   The file system is responsible for managing information on the disk.
*   Information is stored in files, which are stored in directories (folders).
*   Directories can also store other directories, which forms a directory tree.
*   `cd path` changes the current working directory.
*   `ls path` prints a listing of a specific file or directory;
    `ls` on its own lists the current working directory.
*   `pwd` prints the user's current working directory.
*   `whoami` shows the user's current identity.
*   `/` on its own is the root directory of the whole file system.
*   A relative path specifies a location starting from the current location.
*   An absolute path specifies a location from the root of the file system.
*   Directory names in a path are separated with '/' on Unix, but '\\' on Windows.
*   '..' means "the directory above the current one";
    '.' on its own means "the current directory".
*   Most files' names are `something.extension`.
    The extension isn't required,
    and doesn't guarantee anything,
    but is normally used to indicate the type of data in the file.
*   Most commands take options (flags) which begin with a '-'.

## [Creating Things](02-create.html)

*   `cp old new` copies a file.
*   `mkdir path` creates a new directory.
*   `mv old new` moves (renames) a file or directory.
*   `rm path` removes (deletes) a file.
*   `rmdir path` removes (deletes) an empty directory.
*   Use of the Ctrl, or "Control" key may be described in many ways e.g.
    Ctrl-X, Ctrl+X, Control-X, Control+X, `^X`.
*   The shell does not have a trash bin: once something is deleted, it's really gone.
*   Nano is a very simple text editor --- please use something else for real work.

## [Pipes and Filters](03-pipefilter.html)

*   `cat` displays the contents of its inputs.
*   `head` displays the first few lines of its input.
*   `tail` displays the last few lines of its input.
*   `sort` sorts its inputs.
*   `wc` counts lines, words, and characters in its inputs.
*   `*` matches zero or more characters in a filename, so `*.txt` matches all files ending in `.txt`.
*   `?` matches any single character in a filename, so `?.txt` matches `a.txt` but not `any.txt`.
*   `command > file` redirects a command's output to a file.
*   `first | second` is a pipeline: the output of the first command is used as the input to the second.
*   The best way to use the shell is to use pipes to combine simple single-purpose programs (filters).

## [Loops](04-loop.html)

*   A `for` loop repeats commands once for every thing in a list.
*   Every `for` loop needs a variable to refer to the current "thing".
*   Use `$name` to expand a variable (i.e., get its value). `${name}` can also be used.
*   Do not use spaces, quotes, or wildcard characters such as '*' or '?' in filenames, as it complicates variable expansion.
*   Give files consistent names that are easy to match with wildcard patterns to make it easy to select them for looping.
*   Use the up-arrow key to scroll up through previous commands to edit and repeat them.
*   Use Ctrl-R to search through the previously entered commands.
*   Use `history` to display recent commands, and `!number` to repeat a command by number.

## [Shell Scripts](05-script.html)

*   Save commands in files (usually called shell scripts) for re-use.
*   `bash filename` runs the commands saved in a file.
*   `$@` refers to all of a shell script's command-line parameters.
*   `$1`, `$2`, etc., refer to the first command-line parameter, the second command-line parameter, etc.
*   Place variables in quotes if the values might have spaces in them.
*   Letting users decide what files to process is more flexible and more consistent with built-in Unix commands.

## [Finding Things](06-find.html)

*   `find` finds files with specific properties that match patterns.
*   `grep` selects lines in files that match patterns.
*   `--help` is a flag supported by many bash commands, and programs that can be run from within bash, to display more information on how to use these commands or programs.
*   `man command` displays the manual page for a given command.
*   `$(command)` inserts a command's output in place.
